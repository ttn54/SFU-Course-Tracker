The core around which the course is built is C, assembly, and low-level data representation, but this is connected to higher levels (roughly how basic other programming langauges could could be implemented), lower levels (the general structure of a processor), and the role of the processor and its how it is implemented. This course provides an introduction to computer organization, systems programming and the hardware/software interface. Topics include instruction sets, computer arithmetic, datapath design, data formats, addressing modes, memory hierarchies including caches and virtual memory, and multicore architectures. Students learn assembly language programming and design a pipelined RISC V processor. The course is open to any undergraduate who has mastered the 120s material.<br /><br /><strong>RISC V:&nbsp;</strong>This version of the course will study the core components in computer architecture through the lens of the RISC-V (V : Five) ISA. What is RISC V? It is a modern open source instruction set that enables students to learn both assembly-level programming and the digital design of a processor. **This course is a hands-on, programming-heavy course**. Expect to get down and get your hands dirty with C programming and hardware design. We will discuss the fundamental design and engineering trade-offs in computer architecture at every level.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Course Offer Plan 4 Credits:</strong> <br />- <strong>Lab:</strong> There will be dedicated lab days. (required lab). Attendance is required and counts towards your overall grade. In-person. <strong>**Midterms and Exams will be held during the lab so carefully select your lab slot.**</strong><br />- <strong>Biweekly quizzes</strong> - There will be quiz every week administer and graded online. These will be graded. **Instructor Hours (50 minute session) will be instructor hours. Some surprise quizzes will be administered in class.&nbsp;<br />- <strong>Lecture (1hr 50minute)</strong> will be in-person lecture day. I will be on presenting the major concepts fom the week's module. Further time will be spent on answering class-wide questions. <br />- <strong>Videos</strong>&nbsp;- All lecture content will be made available as videos atleast 1 week prior. The expectation is that these videos are watched prior to the class. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipped_classroom&nbsp;<br />-&nbsp;<strong>Midterms and Exams: 2 Midterms and 1 Final.</strong><br /><br /><strong><strong>Text<strong> books<br /></strong><br /></strong></strong>&nbsp;Please try and obtain the eversions of these text books. Please continue to check our course outline for further information. Should this course be taught remotely due to pandemic, students must have access to a computer with internet access, allowing the use of a conferencing system such as Zoom or BB Collaborate Ultra. Some components of the course will require synchronous (real-time) participation during the scheduled lecture and/or exam times. Visual proctoring will most likely be required for midterms and exams. Midterms and Exams will be held in person.<br /><strong><strong><br /><strong>Workload comments<br />This is a 4 credit course.<br /></strong></strong></strong>&nbsp;The comments below are provided based on past student experience. It is to enable you to appropriately select the term in which you take 295. As the first introduction to systems, 295 is an intense course and requires 1) Attending 3hrs of lectures &nbsp;2) 20m of quizes/week 3) 1 hr of labs/week 4) 5 hrs / week for take-home programming assignments (assumes familiarity with C/C++). Your learning outcomes in 295 are highly dependent on whether you are comfortable with the material, and C/C++ programming from 125 and 135. 295 is set up to make you a better programmer and this requires the student to invest the requisite time. As our grading distribution shows; all components are equally important. Hence, please take it in the term that you can dedicate the time.<br /><br />\r\n<h2 class=\"ParagraphTitle\">Topics</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>RISC-V</li>\r\n<li>Bits, Arrays, Pointers</li>\r\n<li>Number formats</li>\r\n<li>Memory layout</li>\r\n<li>Caches</li>\r\n<li>Vectorization</li>\r\n<li>Processor Pipeline and Digital logic</li>\r\n<li>Parallelism</li>\r\n<li>Logical and arithmetic operations</li>\r\n<li>Floating point</li>\r\n</ul>",

The goal is to understand why some seemingly simple problems cannot be solved on computers and others have no efficient (ie fast) solution. In the course, we will see the formal notions of computers, computability and complexity. At the successful completion of this course students will understand why, for example, computer viruses are so pervasive and why no one will ever write a perfect virus checker. We will see how these concepts are related to logic, in particular, the famous Incompleteness Theorem of Godel. Finally, we will see a few surprising results from modern complexity, in particular, the results making use of randomness in computation.<br />\r\n<h2 class=\"ParagraphTitle\">Topics</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Turing Machines as a formalization of the intuitive notion of an algorithm.</li>\r\n<li>Computability (Does a program exist?): basic computability (checking if a program is in an infinite loop), reducibilities and oracles, the Recursion Theorem (existence of computer viruses).</li>\r\n<li>Review of Logic and Godel's Incompleteness Theorem.</li>\r\n<li>Complexity Theory: Non-determinism, the class NP, reductions.</li>\r\n<li>Randomness in Computation: Interactive Proofs.</li>\r\n<li>Approximation algorithms and hardness of approximation: Probabilistically Checkable Proofs and the PCP Theorem.</li>\r\n</ul>",

In its modern era, graphics research has extended its reach to cover the synthesis and generation of all visual content, beyond scene projection and rendering. Hence, there is often a need to first acquire an understanding of the visual information being processed and created, which is an analysis task studied in computer vision. Indeed, modern computer graphics has seen &ldquo;an increasing integration of techniques from computer vision&rdquo; (from page 2 of &ldquo;Computer Graphics, Principles and Practice, Third Edition, by Hughes, et al.). In this course, which will be co-taught by two instructors, we will offer an introduction to fundamental concepts and techniques in both computer graphics and computer vision, with more emphasis placed on material that is deemed central to both fields. With a focus on classical topics, we will also shed light on the most recent trend and developments in the fields and the interplay between them. Students completing this course will be well prepared for more advanced courses in both computer graphics and computer vision. Programming assignments will be conducted in WebGL for the graphics-related problems and MATLAB for vision-related ones.<br /><br /></p>\r\n<p><strong>How to take this course:</strong><br />This course is composed of two mandatory and important parts: lecture videos and live lectures. Live lectures are accessible through Zoom where the recordings will be made available, as well as in-person. Every week, you need to watch the lecture videos before coming to the live lectures. The live lectures have many different activities that will help you develop your understanding, where we go over hard concepts and formulations in further detail, discuss your questions on previous week's subjects, programming assignments, and general discussions about every aspect of visual computing.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Online Lectures:</strong><br /><strong>You do not need to attend the lectures in-person to get the best out of this course.</strong>&nbsp;All live lectures will be broadcast over Zoom, where you can ask questions and interact with the professor. The recordings of these lectures will also be made available.</p>",

These problems often involve relatively small inputs, but astronomically-sized search spaces in which solutions may be well hidden. Developing practical software for solving these problems is challenging and costly. This course examines methods for automatically solving these problems based on high-level specifications, much as we use a query language rather than low-level algorithms to answer complex questions about a large data set. The course will pursue two tracks in parallel. In one, we will examine the design and use of real systems that are products of major companies or widely used research tools, including hands-on experience. In the other, we will develop formal foundations to support principled design and analysis of such systems and their use in critical applications, and to understand their strengths and limitations. We will begin with lectures on fundamentals, and toward the end shift to considering current issues and research directions. The course is suitable for students with an interest in research or in tackling problems that are not well solved. A strong discrete math and algorithm background is recommended. Ideally, students should have taken CMPT-307 and CMPT-310, or at least have MACM-201.

      "courseDetails": "<strong>Special Topics in AI, Collective Action and Public Interest AI</strong><br /><br />Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have seen a large surge in interest from researchers, investors, businesses, and everyday end-users. These technologies stand on the shoulders of giants -- they rely on a large body of research in computing and other fields, as well as modern feats of engineering from organizations that operate them. However, they also rely heavily on data, and thus, people.<br /><br />Search engines rely on click data from users and content written by volunteers such as blogs and Wikipedia articles. Recommender systems rely on explicit user feedback (e.g., &ldquo;star ratings&rdquo;) and behavioral data (e.g., browsing history) that reveal user preferences. Supervised learning relies on crowd workers, volunteers, and sometimes unwitting users (e.g., reCAPTCHA participants) to label images and text. And new generative AI systems rely on the wide swathe of content shared on the web. Without this data generated by the public, technologies that use machine learning and statistical models could not exist. The critical role of data suggests an untapped source of power for data creators, i.e., the broad public. Furthermore, it suggests a number of exciting questions about how a data-centric view can advance both AI research and the development of AI products and other systems.<br /><br />In this course, we will explore AI technologies with a data-centric, and thus human-centric lens. We will discuss topics such as:<br />- Exposure to foundational reading in interdisciplinary AI<br />- The intersection of humanities scholarship and technical computing aspects of AI<br />- Modern research in data valuation<br />- Relevant work in social computing, including the impact of online platform design choices.<br />- The potential for collective action involving data. How might social movements -- ranging from protests that withhold data to movements to collect and share data in the public interest -- impact the future of AI?<br />- The economics of data. Students will be introduced to recent work on data markets and unique properties of buying/selling data for AI.<br /><br />We will read papers on these topics together. Students will work together to synthesize and present knowledge from research papers, and present their own opinions on these topics. The course will centre a structured final project that will enable students to conduct interdisciplinary responsible AI research <em>or </em>bring responsible AI concepts to bear in industry contexts.<br /><br />Students may benefit from having taken a course in AI, ML, or data science (or have equivalent experience from e.g. an internship, a research project, a personal project).<br /><br />Example SFU courses:<br />CMPT 310 - Intro Artificial Intelligence<br />CMPT 353 - Computational Data Science<br />CMPT 414 - Computer Vision<br /><br />Having taken an HCI course or relevant social science course (e.g., sociology, economics) is a plus, but CS students without this experience who want to explore interdisciplinary CS work that is &ldquo;human-centered&rdquo; are welcome. Similarly, students in the humanities who have some exposure to data science are also welcome.<br /><br />We will work through a low-stakes \"example assignment\" in week 1 so that students can assess their comfort level.<br /><br />In short, students should ideally be decently comfortable with both (1) working with computational notebooks (Python, R, Julia, etc.), quickly loading and working with quantitative data, training and evaluating machine learning models and (2) reading and critically thinking about new scholarly perspectives and ethical considerations.<br /><br />This course will include a heavy reading component.",

As these graphs often contain sensitive entities and connections, protecting privacy is essential. For example, social networks reveal friendships, interactions, and group affiliations, while healthcare graphs may link patients, treatments, and diagnoses. These expose highly personal information. Without strong privacy guarantees, releasing such data can lead to re-identification or inference of private details, even from seemingly anonymized graphs.<br /><br />Differential privacy is a mathematical framework that ensures an individual's data does not significantly affect the outcome of any analysis, providing strong privacy guarantees regardless of what external information is known. For instance, differential privacy can protect users' friend connections, group affiliations and activity patterns when releasing social network insights, ensuring no one can tell if a specific person was in the data.<br /><br />This course explores recent advances in privacy-preserving graph analytics, with a focus on differential privacy. We will explore key concepts such as the fundamental meaning of privacy for graph data, along with the challenges and solutions in areas like differentially private graph publishing, private graph querying (e.g., paths, degree distribution), and private subgraph and pattern mining.",

      "courseDetails": "<p>Natural Language Processing (NLP) was traditionally a research field heavily reliant on partially supervised machine learning to tackle language tasks. However, the landscape shifted dramatically with the advent of large language models (LLMs), popularized by tools like ChatGPT. Unlike earlier models, LLMs are trained using self-supervised learning, exhibiting remarkable emergent behavior and tackling a wide range of tasks they were never explicitly trained on. This demonstrates that unsupervised learning is scalable and capable of achieving zero-shot performance, where models perform tasks with little to no task-specific examples.</p>\r\n<p>This course delves into language models and representation learning for NLP with a focus on large language models. We will explore key components such as model architecture, effective training strategies, and inference techniques, highlighting their applications across diverse natural language processing tasks. As NLP rapidly evolves, LLMs have become a cornerstone of artificial intelligence research and development.</p>",

      "courseDetails": "Many real computing applications involve computational problems for which no generally efficient algorithms are known. These problems often involve relatively small inputs, but astronomically-sized search spaces in which solutions may be well hidden. Developing practical software for solving these problems is challenging and costly. This course examines methods for automatically solving these problems based on high-level specifications, much as we use a query language rather than low-level algorithms to answer complex questions about a large data set. The course will pursue two tracks in parallel. In one, we will examine the design and use of real systems that are products of major companies or widely used research tools, including hands-on experience. In the other, we will develop formal foundations to support principled design and analysis of such systems and their use in critical applications, and to understand their strengths and limitations. We will begin with lectures on fundamentals, and toward the end shift to considering current issues and research directions. The course is suitable for students with an interest in research or in tackling problems that are not well solved. A strong discrete math and algorithm background is recommended. Ideally, students should have taken CMPT-307 and CMPT-310, or at least have MACM-201.

      "courseDetails": "<strong>Special Topics in AI, Collective Action and Public Interest AI</strong><br /><br />Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have seen a large surge in interest from researchers, investors, businesses, and everyday end-users. These technologies stand on the shoulders of giants -- they rely on a large body of research in computing and other fields, as well as modern feats of engineering from organizations that operate them. However, they also rely heavily on data, and thus, people.<br /><br />Search engines rely on click data from users and content written by volunteers such as blogs and Wikipedia articles. Recommender systems rely on explicit user feedback (e.g., &ldquo;star ratings&rdquo;) and behavioral data (e.g., browsing history) that reveal user preferences. Supervised learning relies on crowd workers, volunteers, and sometimes unwitting users (e.g., reCAPTCHA participants) to label images and text. And new generative AI systems rely on the wide swathe of content shared on the web. Without this data generated by the public, technologies that use machine learning and statistical models could not exist. The critical role of data suggests an untapped source of power for data creators, i.e., the broad public. Furthermore, it suggests a number of exciting questions about how a data-centric view can advance both AI research and the development of AI products and other systems.<br /><br />In this course, we will explore AI technologies with a data-centric, and thus human-centric lens. We will discuss topics such as:<br />- Exposure to foundational reading in interdisciplinary AI<br />- The intersection of humanities scholarship and technical computing aspects of AI<br />- Modern research in data valuation<br />- Relevant work in social computing, including the impact of online platform design choices.<br />- The potential for collective action involving data. How might social movements -- ranging from protests that withhold data to movements to collect and share data in the public interest -- impact the future of AI?<br />- The economics of data. Students will be introduced to recent work on data markets and unique properties of buying/selling data for AI.<br /><br />We will read papers on these topics together. Students will work together to synthesize and present knowledge from research papers, and present their own opinions on these topics. The course will centre a structured final project that will enable students to conduct interdisciplinary responsible AI research <em>or </em>bring responsible AI concepts to bear in industry contexts.<br /><br />Students may benefit from having taken a course in AI, ML, or data science (or have equivalent experience from e.g. an internship, a research project, a personal project).<br /><br />Example SFU courses:<br />CMPT 310 - Intro Artificial Intelligence<br />CMPT 353 - Computational Data Science<br />CMPT 414 - Computer Vision<br /><br />Having taken an HCI course or relevant social science course (e.g., sociology, economics) is a plus, but CS students without this experience who want to explore interdisciplinary CS work that is &ldquo;human-centered&rdquo; are welcome. Similarly, students in the humanities who have some exposure to data science are also welcome.<br /><br />We will work through a low-stakes \"example assignment\" in week 1 so that students can assess their comfort level.<br /><br />In short, students should ideally be decently comfortable with both (1) working with computational notebooks (Python, R, Julia, etc.), quickly loading and working with quantitative data, training and evaluating machine learning models and (2) reading and critically thinking about new scholarly perspectives and ethical considerations.<br /><br />This course will include a heavy reading component.",

      "courseDetails": "Recent advances in graph mining enable the discovery of complex relationships in large, real-world networks. As these graphs often contain sensitive entities and connections, protecting privacy is essential. For example, social networks reveal friendships, interactions, and group affiliations, while healthcare graphs may link patients, treatments, and diagnoses. These expose highly personal information. Without strong privacy guarantees, releasing such data can lead to re-identification or inference of private details, even from seemingly anonymized graphs.<br /><br />Differential privacy is a mathematical framework that ensures an individual's data does not significantly affect the outcome of any analysis, providing strong privacy guarantees regardless of what external information is known. For instance, differential privacy can protect users' friend connections, group affiliations and activity patterns when releasing social network insights, ensuring no one can tell if a specific person was in the data.<br /><br />This course explores recent advances in privacy-preserving graph analytics, with a focus on differential privacy. We will explore key concepts such as the fundamental meaning of privacy for graph data, along with the challenges and solutions in areas like differentially private graph publishing, private graph querying (e.g., paths, degree distribution), and private subgraph and pattern mining.",

Both classical approaches and modern techniques developed within the last 10 years will be covered, and their applications to different areas of artificial intelligence, such as computer vision, natural language processing and audio processing will be highlighted.

This course focuses on solidifying these important skills. By studying mathematical logic, methods of argument, and a wide variety of topics &ndash; such as set theory, number theory, algebra, and group theory - students will better understand what it means to prove things and how to do so rigorously. By working to discover the underlying structure and truth in various mathematical topics, students can expect their problem-solving skills to improve, as well as their ability to form and communicate persuasive logical arguments.</p>\r\n<p>Students planning to take MATH242: Introduction to Analysis I are strongly encouraged to take MATH292 which is designed to support this course. MATH292 also supports students taking MATH240: Algebra I: Linear Algebra by providing the necessary skills to write proofs in any situation, including linear algebra proofs. Students planning on taking MACM 201 or other upper-year mathematics are also encouraged to take this course.</p>\r\n<p>This course may serve as a prerequisite in place of MACM101 for any MATH or MACM course. This course and MACM101 contain some overlap but diverge in content as this course focuses on mathematical proofs, examples, and applications to help prepare you for future courses as a mathematics major or minor.<br /><br />Prerequisites: Pre-Calculus 12 (or equivalent) with a grade of at least A, or one of Math 150, 151, 154, 157 with a minimum grade of C-</p>",

Reviews strategic principles, tactical approaches, and specific technical tools for problem solving, and mathematical problem solving folklore. Emphasis is placed on clarity of exposition and persuasiveness of written argument, and on development of communication skills. Students interested in MATH 480W are encouraged to take the course as soon as they meet the prerequisites, since performance in the Putnam Competition often improves with second and subsequent attempts.

Intended as a preparation for the Putnam Competition, the most challenging and prestigious undergraduate mathematics competition in North America, in which effective presentation of solutions is as important as skill in problem solving. Reviews strategic principles, tactical approaches, and specific technical tools for problem solving, and mathematical problem solving folklore. Emphasis is placed on clarity of exposition and persuasiveness of written argument, and on development of communication skills. Students interested in MATH 480W are encouraged to take the course as soon as they meet the prerequisites, since performance in the Putnam Competition often improves with second and subsequent attempts.

It will provide an introduction to more advanced topics in abstract algebra, with an emphasis on the study of how groups and rings can transform other objects. In the case of groups, the natural notion is that of a group representation, which is simply a vector space endowed with the action of a group. We will study representations of finite groups, where we will see how they can be completely classified (at least in principle). In the case of rings, the natural notion is that of a module, which is a generaliziation of the notion of a vector space over a field. In fact, we will be particularly interested in finding situations in which many of the nice properties of vector spaces (existence of bases, complete classification) still hold. The concepts and techniques occuring in the this course appear in many areas of mathematics, including algebraic and differential geometry, number theory, representation theory, mathematical physics, and topology.</div>\r\n<div class=\"x_elementToProof\"><br />\r\n<div class=\"x_elementToProof\" data-olk-copy-source=\"MessageBody\"><strong>Topics covered will include</strong>:</div>\r\n<div class=\"x_elementToProof\">1.

This course covers Chapters 0-27 (excluding Chapters 13 and 23) of the textbook. Chapters 7, 11, 19, and 24 are section reviews (and thus are optional). Details of the other chapters are as follows:\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>Descriptive Statistics (Chapters 1, 2, and 4 of text)</strong>&nbsp;Basic graphical statistics (e.g., bar graphs, pie charts, histograms, scatterplots) and basic numerical statistics (e.g., sample mean, median, mode, quartiles, standard deviation, correlation) are discussed.

This includes model assessment, comparison of two regression lines, interactions between explanatory variables, and multicollinearity. Additional topics may include identifying unusual points, variable selection, and/or coding categorical predictors.</li>\r\n<li>Analysis of variance (ANOVA): Use of models to compare means of a quantitative response variable between groups de ined by a categorical explanatory variable (e.g. a treatment variable). Includes model assessment and inference for comparison of means.

Students will learn how to implement these methods using standard software packages such as scikit-learn and tensorflow, and how to use large language model (LLM) APIs.

We survey various general statistical techniques: prediction, forecasting, point and interval estimation, and hypothesis testing; we discuss how to assess how well a specific technique works in repeated sampling terms: forecast standard error, standard error of estimation, coverage probabilities, error rates; we consider optimality theory; throughout we examine trade-offs: bias versus variability, type I versus type II error rates, interval coverage versus precision or length, mechanistic versus empirical models, and others. The vision is that we use the techniques of probability to discuss inference in the face of uncertainty. I will start with inference and fill in background in probability as needed. Our focus is chapters 6 through 11 of Larry Wasserman's text All of Statistics but I don't think you really need the text. It is available electronically through the library.<br /><br />1. Probability: random variable, expectation, inequalities, and convergence<br />2. Inference: Parametric and nonparametric models, empirical distribution function, bootstrap, maximum likelihood and related methods, properties of MLEs and related methods, hypothesis testing and p-values, simulation, selected topics.<br /><br /><strong>Course Details:</strong><br /><br />\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Lecture</strong>: This will be a standard in person lecture-based offering. During the pandemic I pre-recorded lectures which will be available on Canvas and on SFU&rsquo;s Mediasite.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Website</strong>: There will be a variety of material available in Canvas. I will not be using Zoom or recording the lectures. My own website has lots of extras from older versions of the course.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Office Hours</strong>: I will be on campus most days in the fall and will hold office hours before the lectures.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Assignments</strong>: These play a modest role in evaluation and a big role in learning. They are harder than exams.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<br /><strong>Mode of Teaching:</strong><br />\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Lectures</strong>: In person.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Tutorial</strong>: None</li>\r\n<li><strong>Final exam</strong>: In person.
