The goal is to understand why some seemingly simple problems cannot be solved on computers and others have no efficient (ie fast) solution. In the course, we will see the formal notions of computers, computability and complexity. At the successful completion of this course students will understand why, for example, computer viruses are so pervasive and why no one will ever write a perfect virus checker. We will see how these concepts are related to logic, in particular, the famous Incompleteness Theorem of Godel. Finally, we will see a few surprising results from modern complexity, in particular, the results making use of randomness in computation.<br />\r\n<h2 class=\"ParagraphTitle\">Topics</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Turing Machines as a formalization of the intuitive notion of an algorithm.</li>\r\n<li>Computability (Does a program exist?): basic computability (checking if a program is in an infinite loop), reducibilities and oracles, the Recursion Theorem (existence of computer viruses).</li>\r\n<li>Review of Logic and Godel's Incompleteness Theorem.</li>\r\n<li>Complexity Theory: Non-determinism, the class NP, reductions.</li>\r\n<li>Randomness in Computation: Interactive Proofs.</li>\r\n<li>Approximation algorithms and hardness of approximation: Probabilistically Checkable Proofs and the PCP Theorem.</li>\r\n</ul>",

      "courseDetails": "<p>Classical computer graphics has had a focus on realistic image synthesis, when given an explicitly defined 3D scene. In its modern era, graphics research has extended its reach to cover the synthesis and generation of all visual content, beyond scene projection and rendering. Hence, there is often a need to first acquire an understanding of the visual information being processed and created, which is an analysis task studied in computer vision. Indeed, modern computer graphics has seen &ldquo;an increasing integration of techniques from computer vision&rdquo; (from page 2 of &ldquo;Computer Graphics, Principles and Practice, Third Edition, by Hughes, et al.). In this course, which will be co-taught by two instructors, we will offer an introduction to fundamental concepts and techniques in both computer graphics and computer vision, with more emphasis placed on material that is deemed central to both fields. With a focus on classical topics, we will also shed light on the most recent trend and developments in the fields and the interplay between them. Students completing this course will be well prepared for more advanced courses in both computer graphics and computer vision. Programming assignments will be conducted in WebGL for the graphics-related problems and MATLAB for vision-related ones.<br /><br /></p>\r\n<p><strong>How to take this course:</strong><br />This course is composed of two mandatory and important parts: lecture videos and live lectures. Live lectures are accessible through Zoom where the recordings will be made available, as well as in-person. Every week, you need to watch the lecture videos before coming to the live lectures. The live lectures have many different activities that will help you develop your understanding, where we go over hard concepts and formulations in further detail, discuss your questions on previous week's subjects, programming assignments, and general discussions about every aspect of visual computing.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Online Lectures:</strong><br /><strong>You do not need to attend the lectures in-person to get the best out of this course.</strong>&nbsp;All live lectures will be broadcast over Zoom, where you can ask questions and interact with the professor. The recordings of these lectures will also be made available.</p>",

These problems often involve relatively small inputs, but astronomically-sized search spaces in which solutions may be well hidden. Developing practical software for solving these problems is challenging and costly. This course examines methods for automatically solving these problems based on high-level specifications, much as we use a query language rather than low-level algorithms to answer complex questions about a large data set. The course will pursue two tracks in parallel. In one, we will examine the design and use of real systems that are products of major companies or widely used research tools, including hands-on experience. In the other, we will develop formal foundations to support principled design and analysis of such systems and their use in critical applications, and to understand their strengths and limitations. We will begin with lectures on fundamentals, and toward the end shift to considering current issues and research directions. The course is suitable for students with an interest in research or in tackling problems that are not well solved. A strong discrete math and algorithm background is recommended. Ideally, students should have taken CMPT-307 and CMPT-310, or at least have MACM-201. The individual project requires knowledge of Python programming.<br /><br />\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2 class=\"ParagraphTitle\">Topics</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Intractable AI and optimization problems</li>\r\n<li>Improved versions of best-first search, bounded-suboptimal search, local search, etc.</li>\r\n<li>Advanced techniques: Generating complex heuristics, pattern databases, bidirectional and dual searches, etc.</li>\r\n<li>A case study of the multi-agent pathfinding problem</li>\r\n<li>Applications in planning, multi-agent/robot systems, games, etc.</li>\r\n</ul>",

We will cover a variety of 3D representations including polygonal meshes, point clouds, voxels, multi-view geometries, neural fields, as well as structured representations. Both classical and modern-day learning-based approaches will be studied. This field is fast evolving with many interesting problems and much aspiration for application development and future research, e.g., in spatial and embodied AI, geometric deep learning, computational design, and creative arts and modeling. Basic mathematical concepts and tools necessary to understand the course will be presented depending on students background.&nbsp;Programming experience in computer graphics (CMPT 363 or equivalent) and machine learning (Python, C++) would be required.

      "courseDetails": "<p>Natural Language Processing (NLP) was traditionally a research field heavily reliant on partially supervised machine learning to tackle language tasks. However, the landscape shifted dramatically with the advent of large language models (LLMs), popularized by tools like ChatGPT. Unlike earlier models, LLMs are trained using self-supervised learning, exhibiting remarkable emergent behavior and tackling a wide range of tasks they were never explicitly trained on. This demonstrates that unsupervised learning is scalable and capable of achieving zero-shot performance, where models perform tasks with little to no task-specific examples.</p>\r\n<p>This course delves into language models and representation learning for NLP with a focus on large language models. We will explore key components such as model architecture, effective training strategies, and inference techniques, highlighting their applications across diverse natural language processing tasks. As NLP rapidly evolves, LLMs have become a cornerstone of artificial intelligence research and development.</p>",

      "courseDetails": "Many real computing applications involve computational problems for which no generally efficient algorithms are known. These problems often involve relatively small inputs, but astronomically-sized search spaces in which solutions may be well hidden. Developing practical software for solving these problems is challenging and costly. This course examines methods for automatically solving these problems based on high-level specifications, much as we use a query language rather than low-level algorithms to answer complex questions about a large data set. The course will pursue two tracks in parallel. In one, we will examine the design and use of real systems that are products of major companies or widely used research tools, including hands-on experience. In the other, we will develop formal foundations to support principled design and analysis of such systems and their use in critical applications, and to understand their strengths and limitations. We will begin with lectures on fundamentals, and toward the end shift to considering current issues and research directions. The course is suitable for students with an interest in research or in tackling problems that are not well solved. A strong discrete math and algorithm background is recommended. Ideally, students should have taken CMPT-307 and CMPT-310, or at least have MACM-201.

      "courseDetails": "<strong>Special Topics in AI, Collective Action and Public Interest AI</strong><br /><br />Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have seen a large surge in interest from researchers, investors, businesses, and everyday end-users. These technologies stand on the shoulders of giants -- they rely on a large body of research in computing and other fields, as well as modern feats of engineering from organizations that operate them. However, they also rely heavily on data, and thus, people.<br /><br />Search engines rely on click data from users and content written by volunteers such as blogs and Wikipedia articles. Recommender systems rely on explicit user feedback (e.g., &ldquo;star ratings&rdquo;) and behavioral data (e.g., browsing history) that reveal user preferences. Supervised learning relies on crowd workers, volunteers, and sometimes unwitting users (e.g., reCAPTCHA participants) to label images and text. And new generative AI systems rely on the wide swathe of content shared on the web. Without this data generated by the public, technologies that use machine learning and statistical models could not exist. The critical role of data suggests an untapped source of power for data creators, i.e., the broad public. Furthermore, it suggests a number of exciting questions about how a data-centric view can advance both AI research and the development of AI products and other systems.<br /><br />In this course, we will explore AI technologies with a data-centric, and thus human-centric lens. We will discuss topics such as:<br />- Exposure to foundational reading in interdisciplinary AI<br />- The intersection of humanities scholarship and technical computing aspects of AI<br />- Modern research in data valuation<br />- Relevant work in social computing, including the impact of online platform design choices.<br />- The potential for collective action involving data. How might social movements -- ranging from protests that withhold data to movements to collect and share data in the public interest -- impact the future of AI?<br />- The economics of data. Students will be introduced to recent work on data markets and unique properties of buying/selling data for AI.<br /><br />We will read papers on these topics together. Students will work together to synthesize and present knowledge from research papers, and present their own opinions on these topics. The course will centre a structured final project that will enable students to conduct interdisciplinary responsible AI research <em>or </em>bring responsible AI concepts to bear in industry contexts.<br /><br />Students may benefit from having taken a course in AI, ML, or data science (or have equivalent experience from e.g. an internship, a research project, a personal project).<br /><br />Example SFU courses:<br />CMPT 310 - Intro Artificial Intelligence<br />CMPT 353 - Computational Data Science<br />CMPT 414 - Computer Vision<br /><br />Having taken an HCI course or relevant social science course (e.g., sociology, economics) is a plus, but CS students without this experience who want to explore interdisciplinary CS work that is &ldquo;human-centered&rdquo; are welcome. Similarly, students in the humanities who have some exposure to data science are also welcome.<br /><br />We will work through a low-stakes \"example assignment\" in week 1 so that students can assess their comfort level.<br /><br />In short, students should ideally be decently comfortable with both (1) working with computational notebooks (Python, R, Julia, etc.), quickly loading and working with quantitative data, training and evaluating machine learning models and (2) reading and critically thinking about new scholarly perspectives and ethical considerations.<br /><br />This course will include a heavy reading component.",
